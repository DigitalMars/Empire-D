Extracted some missing resource files from the exe:

empire.ico
blastmas.bmp
unknown1.bmp
cursor.bmp

----------
makefile

Fixed filenames in clean - winemp not empire
Removed dependence on winemp.lnk, and used DMD to link so that debugging information can be is linked in

----------
empire.rc

Set Win9x dialog style
Put the menu shortcut keys in the right place
In InitBox, fixed 'Demo' to be a checkbox
Removed option of 0 opponents from InitBox - it doesn't work and apparently isn't meant to
Added Save As command

----------
winmain.d

Cleaned up workaround to DMD 0.86 bug in std.c.windows.windows
Fixed IDM_NEW so that cancelling works
Set correct open/save dialogs and appropriate flags
Deselected pens so that they're actually deleted, eliminating resource leaks
Create the dashed pen only once on startup
Clear filename on new game
Implemented separate Save and Save As commands
Implemented prompt to save on exit, new or open
Highlight current square only if POV player's turn (still needs some work)

----------
move.d

Added invalidateLoc calls to update current square highlight
(works for 2 players, stuck for 3 or more)

----------
eplayer.d

Fixed debugging calls to non-existent functions
Added magic cursor position LOC_HIDDEN, to avoid a misleading highlight at the end of the player's turn
Disabled cwatch - it either does nothing or causes Empire to hang

----------
display.d

Clear dirty flag on loss of game

----------
twin.d

Auto-detect location of exe, and look for help file there
Catch file not found error

----------
newdisplay.d

Refactored the text display engine to make more sense for D and for a GUI app.
