Fixed bugs
----------
File _open_ dialog used to _save_ a file
Leaks resources like crazy
Bogus highlight at end of turn
Need separate save/save as commands
	Prompt to replace
	Prompt to save on exit/new/open
Cannot find help.txt if directory has been changed e.g. when opening/saving
Immediately quits if cannot find help.txt
Status display blank after restoring from minimized
If no opponents, game doesn't respond at all (removed one-player option from UI)
Bits of status display often out of date
Starting a demo first thing causes AV
Help window cannot be scrolled by dragging the slider

Outstanding bugs
----------------
Status display blank after opening file
Scroll bars in help window should have a page size
Save/Save As needs to be disabled when no game is active
Setting of dirty flag wants work
Takes two timeslices to increment human player's turn, but only one for computer player (noticeable at beginning of the game)
Change POV is unresponsive for more than two players
Asking for 5 opponents, i.e. 6 players, delivers a 5-player game

Interface quirks
----------------
Should scroll to scene of attack (?)
Should show blast graphic when attacking cities

Possible enhancements
---------------------
Survey with mouse
